[ ] empty token O.o
[ ] still problems with uploads: during a gsm call, upload is somewhat "paused"
    and never resumed, unless message center is restarted, triggering a new upload
[ ] display status text somewhere
[ ] background loading of contact avatars
[ ] custom background: sampleSize hard-coded to 4
[ ] duplicated messages - maybe it's because:
    * user sends a message while message center is up but still connecting
    * message will be marked as pending in database but could be also in pendingJobs queue
    * when message center finally connects and authenticates, it process pendingJobs queue *and* pending messages from database
[ ] put encryption icon above message status icon
[ ] make IBinder from MessageCenterService a static class
[ ] massive message sending tests and benchmarks (especially memory leaks)
[x] mark registered=1 when a message is delivered
[x] status icon invisibile (not gone) in conversations list
