[ ] status: use activity instead of dialog
[ ] ListView: still issues with fading edge
[ ] ActionBarSherlock: need to use the platform-specific indeterminate progress
[ ] convert manual validation to a separated activity
[ ] manual validation without requesting SMS
[ ] tablet: refactor message list view
[ ] handle external storage presence
[ ] still problems with uploads: during a gsm call, upload is somewhat "paused"
    and never resumed, unless message center is restarted, triggering a new upload
[ ] image sending: user can choose to compress/scale down before sending it
[ ] background loading of contact avatars
[ ] custom background: sampleSize hard-coded to 4
    (actually we should save a sample on our own and load it instead)
[ ] put encryption icon above message status icon (or use an emblem onto status icon)
[x] sync: testing needed for country code in offline mode
[-] tablet: show home as back button when pushing fragments to the stack
[x] ComposeMessage(Fragment)/menu: keep references to MenuItems instead of triggering invalidateOptionsMenu
[x] contacts list: brighter sync button icon
[x] sync: refresh menu item and indeterminate progress should reflect the current sync state


FUTURE:
[ ] quick voice messages
[ ] check if errors are handled correctly, especially if server behaves bad
[ ] quick reply
[ ] (plural) list -> (singular) list (??)
[ ] use cached last seen/status if network error
[ ] HTTP (over SSL) connection support
[ ] image messages: honor EXIF data (orientation in particular)
[ ] fragment preferences activity
[ ] make IBinder from MessageCenterService a static class
[ ] massive message sending tests and benchmarks (especially memory leaks)
[ ] separate processes (main/UI, message center, sync adapter)
[ ] external storage backup
[x] compose->menu->attach: choose between media types
[x] support for VCard exchange
