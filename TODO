[ ] empty token O.o
[ ] use cached last seen/status if network error
[ ] still problems with uploads: during a gsm call, upload is somewhat "paused"
    and never resumed, unless message center is restarted, triggering a new upload
[ ] image sending: user can choose to compress/scale down before sending it
[ ] background loading of contact avatars
[ ] custom background: sampleSize hard-coded to 4
    (actually we should save a sample on our own and load it instead)
[ ] put encryption icon above message status icon
[ ] make IBinder from MessageCenterService a static class
[ ] massive message sending tests and benchmarks (especially memory leaks)
[x] duplicated messages (it was a server problem LOL)
[x] display status text somewhere
[x] mark registered=1 when a message is delivered
[x] status icon invisibile (not gone) in conversations list
