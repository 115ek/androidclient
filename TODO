[ ] smileys/emoticons support
[ ] status should be encrypted with own number so only users who know us can view it
[ ] ActionBarSherlock: need to use the platform-specific indeterminate progress
[ ] ListView: still issues with fading edge
[ ] paginated message list view (load only as needed)
[ ] tablet: refactor message list view
[ ] handle external storage presence
[ ] still problems with uploads: during a gsm call, upload is somewhat "paused"
    and never resumed, unless message center is restarted, triggering a new upload
[ ] image sending: user can choose to compress/scale down before sending it
[ ] background loading of contact avatars
[ ] custom background: sampleSize hard-coded to 4
    (actually we should save a sample on our own and load it instead)
[x] manual validation without requesting SMS
[x] new login procedure
[x] multiserver support
    [x] check if server supports auth token generation
[x] offline mode
[x] privacy settings
[x] sync: contacts from other sources (eg SIM)
[x] MessageListItem: layout issues with date rect
[x] use a cleartext warning icon instead of encryption icon
[x] status: use activity instead of dialog
    [x] invert order of ok/cancel buttons for API >= 14


FUTURE:
[ ] quick voice messages
[ ] check if errors are handled correctly, especially if server behaves bad
[ ] quick reply
[ ] store older messages in external storage / load on demand
[ ] (plural) list -> (singular) list (??)
[ ] use cached last seen/status if network error
[ ] HTTP (over SSL) connection support
[ ] image messages: honor EXIF data (orientation in particular)
[ ] fragment preferences activity
[ ] make IBinder from MessageCenterService a static class
[ ] massive message sending tests and benchmarks (especially memory leaks)
[ ] separate processes (main/UI, message center, sync adapter)
[ ] external storage backup
