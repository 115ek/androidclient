[ ] ListView: still issues with fading edge with pre-Honeycomb
[ ] paginated message list view (load only as needed)
[ ] tablet: refactor message list view
[ ] handle external storage presence
[ ] still problems with uploads: during a gsm call, upload is somewhat "paused"
    and never resumed, unless message center is restarted, triggering a new upload
[ ] image sending: user can choose to compress/scale down before sending it
[ ] background loading of contact avatars
[ ] custom background: sampleSize hard-coded to 4
    (actually we should save a sample on our own and load it instead)
[-] something is happening with emoji (crash report by Fabio - hacked firmware?)

FUTURE:
[ ] BOSH support
[ ] quick voice messages
[ ] check if errors are handled correctly, especially if server behaves bad
[ ] quick reply
[ ] autosync contacts data (thread started on first application load, singleton cache)
[ ] store older messages in external storage / load on demand
[ ] (plural) list -> (singular) list (??)
[ ] use cached last seen/status if network error
[ ] image messages: honor EXIF data (orientation in particular)
[ ] fragment preferences activity
[ ] make IBinder from MessageCenterService a static class
[ ] massive message sending tests and benchmarks (especially memory leaks)
[ ] external storage backup
[ ] XML/XSLT message user backup/restore

PLANS:
[ ] separate processes (main/UI, message center, sync adapter)
